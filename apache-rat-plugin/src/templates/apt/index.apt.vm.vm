The RAT Maven Plugin

  The <<<apache-rat-plugin>>> is used to run RAT in the Maven environment. It
  verifies that the source code matches standards like the
  {{{https://www.apache.org/legal/src-headers.html}ASF Source Header
  and Copyright Notice Policy}}.

* Usage

  The RAT Maven plugin has two basic features.

  <<<apache-rat:check>>> will generate a report as a simple text file, called <<<target/rat.txt>>>.  This report contains
  the report as specified by the options specified.

  <<<apache-rat:report>>> will add the report to the generated site.

** Writing the report to a text file

  The <<<apache-rat:check>>> goal creates a text file with the report.
  This is done by adding a section like the following to the <<<pom.xml>>>:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <build>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </build>
------------------------------------------------------------------

  Once the plugin is specified the report can be generated from the command
  line by simply typing:

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn apache-rat:check
------------------------------------------------------------------

  We have provided an example of {{{./examples/verify.html}running the plugin automatically}}.

** Adding the report to the generated site

  A section like the following must be added to the <<<pom.xml>>> will automatically generated the report when you
  run the <<<site>>> target.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  <reporting>
    <plugins>
      ...
      <plugin>
        <groupId>org.apache.rat</groupId>
        <artifactId>apache-rat-plugin</artifactId>
        <version>${project.version}</version>
      </plugin>
      ...
    </plugins>
  </reporting>
------------------------------------------------------------------

  Run the <<<site>>> target.

------------------------------------------------------------------
  mvn site
------------------------------------------------------------------

* Configuration Options

  There are a number of {{{apache-rat-plugin/mvn_options.html}configuration options}} available to configure RAT.  These options
  are derived from the command line version of RAT and function the same way.

* Examples

  The following examples should provide a better understanding of some usages of the RAT Maven Plugin.

  * {{{./examples/basic.html}Basic use}} of the <<apache-rat:check>> goal.

  * {{{./examples/verify.html}Automatically running}} the <<apache-rat:check>> goal
    when the project is built.

  * Adding the report to the {{{./examples/site.html}generated site}}.

  * Applying a {{{./examples/custom-license.html}custom license}}.
